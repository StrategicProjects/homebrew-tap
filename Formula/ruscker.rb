# Homebrew formula for Ruscker.
#
# This is the canonical copy, version-controlled here. It is published
# by copying it into the tap repo `StrategicProjects/homebrew-tap` as
# `Formula/ruscker.rb` (see packaging/homebrew/README.md), after which
#   brew install strategicprojects/tap/ruscker
# works.
#
# On macOS there is no prebuilt binary yet, so the formula builds from
# source (needs Rust). On Linux it pulls the static musl tarball that
# `release.yml` attaches to the GitHub Release.
#
# When cutting a release, update `version` and the three `sha256`
# values (the Linux tarball checksums are in the release's
# `*.sha256` assets; the macOS source checksum is the GitHub
# auto-generated source tarball's sha256).
